This repository contains core components of the Graph-PAVNet project, which is implemented in both MATLAB and Python. (The official paper will be released later) 
The code shared here is directly related to the methods described in our research paper, and we continue to optimize the pipeline using advanced network model encapsulation.
Thanks for your attention.
